>## MongoDB is an open-source document database, and leading NoSQL database. MongoDB is written in c++

This tutorial will give you great understanding on MongoDB concepts needed to create and deploy a highly scalable and performance oriented database.

>## Audience

This tutorial is designed for Software Professionals who are willing to learn MongoDB Database in simple and easy steps. This tutorial will give you great understanding on MongoDB concepts and after completing this tutorial you will be at intermediate level of expertise from where you can take yourself at higher level of expertise.

>## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of database, text editor and execution of programs etc. Because we are going to develop high performance database, so it will be good if you have understanding on basic concepts of Database (RDBMS).

>## What is MongoDB? 

-  MongoDB is a cross-platform, document oriented database that provides, high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. MongoDB works on concept of collection and document.

>## Database

Database is a physical container for collections. Each database gets its own set of files on the file system. A single MongoDB server typically has multiple databases.

>## Collection

Collection is a group of MongoDB documents. It is the equivalent of an RDBMS table. A collection exists within a single database. Collections do not enforce a schema. Documents within a collection can have different fields. Typically, all documents in a collection are of similar or related purpose.

>## Document

A document is a set of key-value pairs. Documents have dynamic schema. Dynamic schema means that documents in the same collection do not need to have the same set of fields or structure, and common fields in a collection's documents may hold different types of data. 
Any relational database has a typical schema design that shows number of tables and the relationship between these tables. While in MongoDB there is no concept of relationship

>## Advantages of MongoDB over RDBMS

    Schema less : MongoDB is document database in which one collection holds different different documents. Number of fields, content and size of the document can be differ from one document to another.

    Structure of a single object is clear

    No complex joins

    Deep query-ability. MongoDB supports dynamic queries on documents using a document-based query language that's nearly as powerful as SQL

    Tuning

    Ease of scale-out: MongoDB is easy to scale

    Conversion / mapping of application objects to database objects not needed

    Uses internal memory for storing the (windowed) working set, enabling faster access of data

>## Why should use MongoDB

    Document Oriented Storage : Data is stored in the form of JSON style documents

    Index on any attribute

    Replication & High Availability

    Auto-Sharding

    Rich Queries

    Fast In-Place Updates

    Professional Support By MongoDB

>## Where should use MongoDB?

    Big Data

    Content Management and Delivery

    Mobile and Social Infrastructure

    User Data Management

    Data Hub
